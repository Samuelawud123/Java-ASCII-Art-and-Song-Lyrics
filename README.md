# Java ASCII Art and Song Lyrics

## Overview

This repository contains Java programs that focus on text-based ASCII art and a rendition of the "Five Little Ducks" song. The projects demonstrate fundamental programming techniques, such as loops, methods, and string manipulation, in a fun and creative way.

## Coursework

These files are part of an assignment for an introductory programming course. The projects include:
- Printing a duck in ASCII art vertically.
- Printing multiple ducks in a horizontal line using ASCII art.
- Outputting the lyrics of the "Five Little Ducks" song.

## Files

1. **`Duck.java`**:
   - Prints a text-based duck vertically using ASCII art.
   - Contains methods to print one or multiple ducks.

2. **`ExtraCredit.java`**:
   - Prints multiple ducks in a horizontal line using ASCII art.
   - This is the extra credit task, expanding the original concept to a new format.

3. **`Lyrics.java`**:
   - Outputs the lyrics of the "Five Little Ducks" song.
   - Demonstrates the use of methods to manage repetitive text patterns in the song's verses.

## Usage

- **Compile and Run**: Use a Java compiler to compile and run the files. For example:
  ```bash
  javac Duck.java
  java Duck
